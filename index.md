My name is Cornelius Krull, I am physicist by trade, working in nanoscience. I am passionate about the possibilities (deep) machine learning is opening. Currrently, I am applying deep learning and reinforcement learning to advanced electron-based microscopy. 

I obtained my PhD in Physics of nano-systems mid 2012 at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain. My research in fundamental science has been very successful, and I have published results in several high impact journals (Nature Materials, Physical Review Letters, etc ). My PhD Thesis was recognised in the prestigious [Springer Thesis](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319026596) series.

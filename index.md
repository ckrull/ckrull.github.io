title: About me
---

My name is Cornelius Krull, I am physicist by trade. I am working in nanoscience, molecular electronics,  and surface characterization. My recent projects include combining machine learning approaches with advanced surface science laboratries. I obtained my PhD in Physics of nano-systems mid 2012 at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain. My efforts in fundamental science have been very successful, I have published results in several high impact journals, and my PhD Thesis was recognized in the prestigious Springer Thesis series.

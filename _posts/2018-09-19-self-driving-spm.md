[Scanning Probe Microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy) (SPM) is a powerful surface characterisation technique, that has revolutionised many fields spanning from nano-science to biology. Not only does it allow the recording of atomically resolved image data and insight into material properties, e.g. the electronic structure through Scanning Tunnelling Spectroscopy (STS) or chemical bonds using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy (ncAFM) , but also the manipulation of nanoscopic systems with the same level of precision. However, achieving these resolutions and maintaining stable operation requires an expert user to monitor and control the experimental conditions of the instrument, the sample and, in particular, the probe. Consequently, advanced SPM is mainly found in specialist laboratories.

We are working on a machine learning based framework to operate an SPM autonomously. It detects the experimental conditions  and intelligently addresses any arising issues to acquire data without the need for human supervision.

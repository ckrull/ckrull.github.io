[Scanning Probe Microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_probe_microscopy) (SPM) is a powerful surface characterisation technique, that has revolutionised many scientific fields ranging from nano-science to biology. Its ability to resolve structures down to the level of individual atoms has led to many impressive insights and a [nobel prize](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1986/summary/).  But SPM is more than that, it is also a tool to manipulate individual atoms to create any desired shape for example to write letters, quantum objects or create [movies. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSCX78-8-q0)

However, these feats come at a price. Operation of an SPM is not straightforward and requires expertise and  impressive amounts of patience.  Maintaining an SPM probe in good working conditions involves [*soul destroying repetition*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03305-2). This is where deep learning comes in. We are currently working on a machine learning framework that can to operate an SPM autonomously. It intelligently detects arising issues and repairs them without the need for human supervision. 

Publication in preparation, stay tuned for more details.

Drifting icebergs pose a threat to navigation and shipping activities in remote areas e.g. the east coast of Canada. In many areas satellite based monitoring Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images are the only viable option to detect them. However other objects such as ships can have similar SAR signatures. This project uses deep learning (Convolutional Neural Networks), random forests, k-nearest-neighbours and ensemble methods to discriminate between ships and iceberg in SAR images. Achievingan accuracy of over 90%. The project is based on the [Statoil/C-CORE Iceberg Classifier Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge).

**Highlights:**

- Image classification 
- CNNs, random forests, k-NN and ensemble methods
- k-fold cross validation for deep learning

I did this project as part of my Machine Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.
